# Mod Builder
This repository contains the source code and Dockerfile for the Docker image in which we build the ElectricalAge mod.

To prevent compilation errors due to incompatibility with new library version, it hosts required file locally. 

The Docker image is automatically pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/electricalage/build)
